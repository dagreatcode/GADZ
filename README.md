This app uses NodeJS and Express on the back end along with MongoDB as the database. The user interface was built using React.
bash install.sh
npm run dev
open localhost:8081 in browser

This project is a web application that allows truckers and shippers to interact with each other. The
application will have a user interface that allows the truckers and the shippers to view their accounts,
view their profiles, view their shipments, view their truckers, view their payments, and view their
shipments. The application will also have a system for the truckers and the shippers to log
in/out, reset their passwords, forgot their passwords, change their passwords, delete their accounts,
edit their accounts, and view their accounts. The application will also have a system for the truckers
and the shippers to view their shipments, view their truckers, view their payments, and view
their shipments. The application will also have a system for the truckers and the shippers to
view their shipments, view their truckers, view their payments, and view their shipments.

Once logged in, users have full permissions to access all features.
To add additional user roles, you will need to modify the User model and its associated views.

### Deployment

Deployed using Heroku. The app runs on Ruby on Rails version 5.0.3 and uses PostgreSQL as the database.
It has been set up to automatically scale horizontally using Heroku's Cedar stack.
Additionally, it uses Redis for caching. This means that any time a page is loaded, the server checks
Additionally, it uses Amazon S3 for file storage. The application connects to an AWS RDS instance for database storage.
Additionally, it uses Amazon S3 for storage of files. The application is configured to use CloudFront for serving static content. This means that
Additionally, it uses Amazon S3 for file storage and CloudFront for content delivery.
Both services provide high availability and load balancing out of the box.

### Known Issues

There are no known issues with the current version of Asset Tracker. However, please note that it was developed during a short period of time
There are no known issues at present. However, please note that this project was developed primarily
for demonstration purposes and may not be suitable for production use without further development.

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` : Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
  The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
  You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test` : Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
  See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run build` : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
  Your app is ready to be deployed!

- `npm run eject` :
  **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
  If you aren’t satisfied with the built-in config and you want to add custom configuration please use the `npm run eject` command
  There are many ways to deploy a react application but a popular option is to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)<br><br><br>

###### Configure Redux and Intl

Inside src/index.tsx file import following modules at top:
typescript
javascript
Add store configuration inside the Provider component:

```
const store = createStore(rootReducer);
ReactDOM.render(
<Provider store={store}>
<IntlProvider locale="en">
<App />
</IntlProvider>,
document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);
```

To add new messages to intl, go to /src/i18n folder and edit en.json or create a new language file (e.g., es.json).
To make your app work offline and load faster, you might want to look into service workers. Service workers are scripts that your browser runs in
Create an en.json file in /public folder with content:

```

{
"hello": "Hello {name}!"
}

```

Use it in App.tsx like this:

```

import \* as React from 'react';
import { addLocaleData } from 'react-intl';
import en from './locales/en.json';
addLocaleData([...]); // Add all locales here
interface IProps {
name?: string;
}
class App extends React.Component<IProps, {}> {
render() {
const { name } = this.props;
return (
<div className='app'>
<h1>{formatMessage({ id: 'hello' }, { name })}</h1>
</div>
);
}
}
export default App;

```

To use formatMessage function you need to wrap your components with IntlProvider and provide a locale prop. In this case we used English ('')
To use formatMessage function you need to wrap your components into IntlProvider and provide a locale prop. In this case we used English ('en')
Install react-intl by running npm install --save react-intl and then add following code to your index.html file:
