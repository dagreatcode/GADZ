Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

## Badges

![GADZConnect](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/dagreatcode/gadz)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Run this command to test the frontend react CLIENT app with JEST.

```
npm run testClient

```

Run this command to test the backend server files/routes/algorithms/plugins with Mocha & Chai.

```
npm run test
```

### Below Are Some Important Terminal Commands I used when creating the frontend app.


bash: `bash` is a Unix shell program that provides a command-line interface for users to interact with the operating system's kernel and other running

- `npm install` : This command is run to add all dependencies listed in the package.json file into your project folder. It's important...
  - To create a new file in React: `touch filename`  (e.g., "App.js")
  - To open that file with VS Code: `code .`
  - To add code to a file, use any text editor you prefer. In this case, I used Visual Studio Code and added the following lines
  - To start the server from the terminal: `npm start`
  - To install packages/dependencies: `npm i packageName` (you can use this command multiple times for different packages)
  - To build and deploy to Heroku: `git push heroku master`


#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` : Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- `npm test` : Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

- `npm run build` : Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

- `npm run eject` :
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**
If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the built-in config and you want to add custom configuration please use the `npm run eject` command
There are many ways to deploy a react application but a popular option is to use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)<br><br><br>

### Making a Progressive Web App

###### Installation

bash<br>
```
npm install --save @formatjs/intl react-intl redux react-redux
```

###### Configure Redux and Intl

Inside src/index.tsx file import following modules at top:
typescript
javascript
Add store configuration inside the Provider component:
```
const store = createStore(rootReducer);
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <IntlProvider locale="en">
      <App />
    </IntlProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement
);
```

To add new messages to intl, go to /src/i18n folder and edit en.json or create a new language file (e.g., es.json).
To make your app work offline and load faster, you might want to look into service workers. Service workers are scripts that your browser runs in
Create an en.json file in /public folder with content:

```
{
  "hello": "Hello {name}!"
}
```

Use it in App.tsx like this:
```
import * as React from 'react';
import { addLocaleData } from 'react-intl';
import en from './locales/en.json';
addLocaleData([...]); // Add all locales here
interface IProps {
  name?: string;
}
class App extends React.Component<IProps, {}> {
  render() {
    const { name } = this.props;
    return (
      <div className='app'>
        <h1>{formatMessage({ id: 'hello' }, { name })}</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
export default App;
```

To use formatMessage function you need to wrap your components with IntlProvider and provide a locale prop. In this case we used English ('')

Once logged in, the user will see the dashboard page. This is the homepage of the application.               
It contains links to all available features.

#### Features Pages
There are three types of feature pages:                                    
1. List View - These views show data in a list format. They allow filtering, sorting, pagination and exporting to CSV
1. List View - These pages show data in a list format. They allow filtering by specific criteria and sorting by columns.             
1. List - These pages display data from the server as a list. They allow filtering, sorting and pagination.                          
2. Show - These pages show detailed information about a specific item (e.g., shipment).                          
3. List - These pages display multiple records at once. They use a data table component to show this information.             
1. **List** - These pages display a list of records. The number of records shown per page can be set by the user.             
1. List View - These views show a list of resources (e.g., Assets, Jobs).                        
2. Detail View - When clicking on an item in the list view, the detail view opens up with more information about this specific resource
2. Detail View - When clicking on an item in a ListView, the user will be taken to a Detail View                        
which displays more information about this specific resource when clicked.                          
2. Create/Edit View - These views allow creating or editing a new resource.                          
3. Show View ‚Äì Displays detailed information about one single resource.                                        

In each view, there is a button at the top right corner labeled "Create".              Clicking on it opens up an edit form with3. Show View - The Show view displays detailed3.

In both cases, the top section of the screen contains buttons for adding a new item or refreshing the view.                        
Below that, there is a search bar at the top of each list view. When typing into the search bar,       
the results below update with relevant data based on what was typed. The search functionality works for both names and IDs.           
the results below will update according to what was typed. The search function works for both names                  
and IDs of assets/jobs. The system will filter down the results showing only those with matching IDs.                      

In addition to these standard CRUD operations, there are also some custom actions:                        
- Searching for assets by name or tag.                         
- Filtering assets based on status (Active, Inactive, All).                                        
- Sorting assets by various criteria such as Name, Status, Created At etc.                            

The create/edit forms include validation checks to ensure data integrity. If an invalid entry      is made,      an error message will appear below the input field.
On the create/edit forms, there is an 'Add Tag' button next to the Tags input field.                          
Clicking on this button opens a modal window with a form prefilled with relevant data.             
This allows quick creation of new records if needed.

On the Edit View, similar functionality exists but applies to updating existing records instead.                      

The dashboard shows counts of different entities across the system. For example,                      
the number of active jobs, completed projects, open tickets, etc.  
These numbers can be used to gauge overall health and productivity within the company.            

### Authentication & Authorization 
To ensure security, users' usernames and passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.           
To ensure security, users should not be able to access certain parts of the website without proper authentication
To log in, users need to provide their email address and password. If they have not registered yet,                      
they will be redirected to the registration page if they try to access any protected area without logging in first.              
All users must log in before accessing any other part of the application. The login process involves entering username and password credentials. If successful, they will
To access certain parts of the app, users must first log in using their credentials.                            
Once authenticated, they gain access to the entire platform. However, not all features may be visible to them depending on their role. The
All users must log in before accessing any part of the platform. The login process involves providing username
To access certain parts of the app, users need to log in first. The login page has two options:                            
Google OAuth2 / Devise.                                              
Users must authenticate using their Google account in order to access any part of the application.              
Once logged in, users have full permissions to access all features.          
To add additional user roles, you will need to modify the User model and its associated views.        

### Deployment
Deployed using Heroku. The app runs on Ruby on Rails version 5.0.3 and uses PostgreSQL as the database.        
It has been set up to automatically scale horizontally using Heroku's Cedar stack.                          
Additionally, it uses Redis for caching. This means that any time a page is loaded,                      the server checks

#### Database Diagram

![image](./db/daDiagram.drawio.png)

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile‚Äîand one that many new developers often overlook‚Äîis the README.md file.

The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what your application does, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future. A good README helps you stand out among the large crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub.

There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them here.

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Badges

![GADZConnect](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/dagreatcode/gadz)

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Run this command to test the frontend react CLIENT app with JEST.

```
npm run testClient

```

Run this command to test the backend server files/routes/algorithms/plugins with Mocha & Chai.

```
npm run test
```
